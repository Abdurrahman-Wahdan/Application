# Tourist Places Recognition Application

This project encompasses an AI-driven image classification model integrated into an Flutter(Dart) application aimed at assisting users when visiting Turkey. The primary goal is to provide users with information about various tourist destinations in Turkey by leveraging geolocation and other Flutter dependencies.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar**: The application features a navigation bar that allows users to seamlessly navigate between different screens, including the home screen, map view, place recognition using the camera, and the user profile page.

- **Image Recognition**: Users can access the image recognition feature by clicking on the camera button in the navigation bar. Upon clicking, the application prompts users to grant permission to access the device's camera. After permission is granted, users can capture a photo or select an image from the gallery to identify the location using the integrated image classification model.

- **Home Screen**: The home screen provides an overview of various tourist destinations in Turkey, including a list of places to visit and a search bar for easy navigation.

- **Map View**: Users can explore nearby attractions and points of interest through the nearby places feature, accessible from the navigation bar by clicking on the location icon.

- **Profile Page**: The profile page allows users to view and manage their personal information, accessible from the navigation bar.

## Usage

1. Upon launching the application, users are presented with the home screen, showcasing a list of tourist destinations and a search bar.

2. To identify a location, users can click on the camera button in the navigation bar, triggering a prompt to grant permission to access the device's camera.

3. After permission is granted, users can capture a photo or select an image from the gallery.

4. The application utilizes the integrated image classification model to identify the location in the image. The identified location, along with detailed information, is displayed on a dedicated screen.

5. Users can navigate between different screens, including the home screen, map view, place recognition using the camera, and the user profile page, using the navigation bar.

## Note

Due to limitations, the image classification model cannot be included in this repository. However, the application has been developed with a robust API integration, ensuring accurate identification of tourist destinations.
